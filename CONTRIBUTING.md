Did you find a bug? If it is a security vulnerability, please don't open a GitHub issue, instead contact me: thalesmdav@gmail.com

Did you solve a bug, rewrite part of the code, or write a new feature?
Open a GitHub pull request.

If you have never contributed to an open source project, I suggest reading [this article.](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940)
